Convert LCOV test code coverage files to CodeClimate JSON.

Created because I misread the [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.html][Gitlab CI documentation]] and completely glossed
over that you couldn't just drop a CodeClimate JSON file as an artifact and have
Gitlab CI show test coverage metrics..

** Thanks
To [[https://codeclimate.com/][CodeClimate]] for their [[https://github.com/codeclimate/test-reporter][test-reporter]] software.
